	<p><b> Abstract:</b> Let G be an arbitrary non-trivial connected graph. For every two vertices u and v in G, a ( u,v )-path in G is called a rainbow ( u,v )-path if all edges are colored differently. Next, a rainbow ( u, v )-geodesic in G is a rainbow ( u,v )-path of length d(u,v) . Graph G is rainbow connected if for every two vertices u,v ∈ V(G), there exists a rainbow ( u,v )-path. If there exists a rainbow ( u, v )-geodesic in G for every two vertices u, v ∈ V(G) then G is strongly rainbow connected. The rainbow connection number rc(G) is the minimum number of colors needed to make G rainbow connected, while the strong rainbow connection number src(G) is the minimum number of colors needed to make G strongly rainbow connected. Let Tr n be the generalized triangle-ladder graph for n ≥ 2. The triangle-net graph, denoted by H = (Tr n ) m , is constructed by taking m homogeneous generalized triangle-ladder graphs and identifying their terminal vertices, for m ≥ 2. This paper determined the rainbow connection number of the triangle-net graph and the upper bound of the strong rainbow connection number of the graph.</p>
